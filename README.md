#Preparing a custom dataset:#
Building a custom dataset can be a painful process. It might take dozens or even hundreds of hours to collect images, label them, and export them in the proper format. Fortunately, Roboflow makes this process as straightforward and fast as possible. Let me show you how!

#Step 1: Creating project
Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow account. Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow dashboard. Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.
